"""Per-trajectory rollout context isolation via :mod:`contextvars`.

In an async multi-turn rollout, a single ``AgentLoop`` instance services many
concurrent trajectories (one ``asyncio.Task`` per sample). Any per-trajectory
state -- the tau2 ``Environment`` holding a mutable ``FlightDB``, the user
simulator and its running conversation state -- MUST NOT leak across those
concurrent tasks, or trajectory A's tool call would mutate trajectory B's DB
and corrupt both the rollout and the reward.

``contextvars.ContextVar`` gives us exactly this isolation: a value ``set()``
inside one ``asyncio.Task`` is invisible to sibling tasks, because each task
runs with its own copy of the context. This module wraps that primitive in a
small, explicit API so the agent loop can bind the current trajectory once and
any code running *in the async portion* of that trajectory can recover it with
``current_rollout()`` -- without threading the object through every call.

Note on threads: values set here are visible to awaited sub-coroutines within
the same task, but NOT automatically to ``loop.run_in_executor`` worker threads
(a fresh thread does not inherit the caller's context). For executor-bound work
(the blocking litellm user-simulator call, synchronous tau2 tool execution) we
therefore pass the trajectory object *explicitly*. The ContextVar is the clean
in-async accessor; explicit passing is the cross-thread contract. Keeping both
honest is the whole point of the isolation design.
